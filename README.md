It is a Remote internship. For the C++Programming internship, you will need to complete at least 3 tasks for successful completion of the internship.

Task 1: Number Guessing Game

In this task, you were assigned to develop a "Number Guessing Game." The game involves a player attempting to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high or too low. The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the target number or decide to quit. This task required implementing random number generation, user input handling, conditional statements, and loops to create an interactive and engaging game experience.

Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

For this task, you were responsible for creating a "Tic-Tac-Toe Game," a classic two-player board game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking X or O in empty cells. The objective is to form a line of three of their own symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You designed and implemented the game logic to handle player moves, check for wins or ties, and display the current state of the game after each turn. This task required the use of arrays or data structures to represent the game board, condition checking, and looping to create a functional and enjoyable game.

Task 3: To-Do List

In this task, you were assigned to develop a "To-Do List" application. The application allows users to create, manage, and track tasks they need to complete. You implemented features such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, updating task details, and removing tasks. The application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the to-do list and ensures that tasks are organized and easily manageable. This task involved data structures to store tasks, user input handling, and potentially GUI (Graphical User Interface) design if you implemented a graphical interface for the application.

These tasks provided you with a range of experiences in software development, including working with user input, game logic, data structures, conditional statements, loops, and potentially graphical interfaces. They aimed to enhance your skills as a C++ developer and expose you to different aspects of programming and application development.
